# Circuit Fault Identification
This repository contains a C++ program that can efficiently identify faults in a given digital circuit. The program takes a circuit file, fault node location, and fault type as input and outputs the input vector required to trigger the fault and the expected output value. It utilizes a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver to solve the circuit's Boolean expressions and find the fault. The program is designed to be robust, efficient, and easy to use.
